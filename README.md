# rejectionGame

Rejection Game is a training project that was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-best-way-to-learn-to-code-is-to-code-learn-app-architecture-by-building-apps-7ec029db6e00#.55qiwr8vy"> this article</a> by Eric Elliot.

<h5>The game has one rule:</h5>
You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.</br>
Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and youâ€™ll find yourself winning a lot more.

Accepted = 1 point. Rejected = 10 points.
